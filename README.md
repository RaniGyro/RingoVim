# RigoVim
This is just something random that I made for my own fun, I know it is **trash**, and maybe **I'll** update it some day. XD.
But here is the repo, so have fun???

# PLEASE READ THIS!
It has a **LOT** of bugs! HERE ARE THE THINGS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE!

1. It has no Harpoon.
2. The LSP doesn't work
3. The Treesitter doesn't work
